		<t id="0">Ok, this article is only for showing different colours inside the articles.\nWe could use \033Wgrey\033X, \033Bblue\033X, \033Wcyan\033X, \033Wgreen\033X, \033Omagenta\033X, \033Rred\033X,\033Wwhite\033X, \033Wyellow\033X, \033Oorange\033X or the normal colour.</t>			<!-- [100 .. 110], Event Invasion -->

		<t id="110">Dangerous Pirate Hunt</t>
		<t id="111">The wanted criminal \033W%s\033X has recently been seen in \033W%s\033X. This fugitive and his crew are now thought to be fleeing towards \033W%s\033X having evaded the local police. All bounty hunters are asked to track down this villain and destroy them. This is an open invitation to hunt for the \033W%s\033X they were last seen flying, they must to be brought to justice for their crimes against the Commonwealth. The %s military has begun preparing for an assault on them, saying that if no-one will respond to the call to arms, they will take care of this themselves.\n\nSam Branchaw - GalNet Breaking News</t>
		<t id="112">The %s authorities in %s!</t>
		<t id="113">Pirate %s Captured!</t>
		<t id="114">The criminal \033W%s\033X has been swiftly neutralised by a nearby %s military task force. The \033W%s\033X he was piloting was no match for the combined power of several destroyers. Guilty of many crimes, such as human trafficking, drug running, blackmailing and assault, this criminal has been sentenced to death and is to be executed in the next few tazuras. He has chosen to go out like all other space pirates do, being jettisoned out of the airlock without a suit.\n\nSam Branchaw - GalNet Breaking News</t>
		<t id="116">The notorious villain \033W%s\033X will now be considered the late villain \033W%s\033X. This outlaw met their match in the form of \033W%s\033X, a brave bounty hunter who has just received their due reward for ridding the Expansion Region of this scum and their notorious \033W%s\033X. The bounty hunter was commended on saving the military the considerable effort of tracking down the criminal themselves.\n\nSam Branchaw - GalNet Breaking News</t>
		<t id="120">Smugglers become a Real Problem</t>
		<t id="121">A secret spying device that has recently been installed on several trading stations and fake trader ships throughout the Argon territory has yielded exceptional results. Designed for the scanning of transporter cargo holds without alerting the pilot of the ship, the device allows for a quick and discreet check for any smugglers that are operating in the vicinity. So far there has already been a sighting of a smuggler ship in \033W%s\033X. The local military branch which is currently performing target practice in the neighbouring sector has been notified of the problem. It is not clear yet whether they will take any action or not, but if you are \033W%s\033X and you are reading this, we would advise you to dump your illegal freight right now and cease all criminal activities before any action is taken against you.\n\nSis Crass - GalNet News</t>
		<t id="122">The security officials of the trading station in \033W%s\033X have notified the police of a possible smuggler ship, piloted by \033W%s\033X. Though there has been no specific confirmation, they claim that gravidar readings, paired with the new spectroscope tracking device, can be used to determine the contents of a transporter ship cargo hold without forcefully scanning it. So far the readout of the scans of the ship in question is vague, but they definitely indicate a presence of one or more illegal substances onboard. Special scout ships have been sent to confirm the readings, and if necessary, call in backup in the form of military fighters. Smuggling activity has so far been rather low in the Boron section of the Expansion region, we sincerely hope that this is just an isolated incident and does not represent a general rise in criminal activity.\n\nSis Crass - GalNet News</t>
		<t id="123">Split fighter pilots may get their tazura's worth of combat practice, as reports have just surfaced that a smuggler has been noticed in \033W%s\033X by an overzealous and trigger-happy police scout pilot. Split officials have declined any official comment on this, but they did spark up with sudden, gleeful interest when hearing the news. After an admittedly short press briefing, a minor family representative said that he wished to be the lucky pilot that will have the glorious opportunity to blast the criminal scum into oblivion. It may be possible that due to low funding, no official action will be taken, but it is certain that freelance Split pilots may use this chance as free combat training, as there are no laws to protect the ship and life of a smuggler if they refuse to drop their illegal freight. Just to make sure, the smuggler in question is \033W%s\033X. We encourage all law-abiding and upstanding Split citizens to track down this scum and have fun at their expense.\n\nHut N’kt - GalNet News</t>
		<t id="124">An infidel has tried to smuggle illegal goods in \033W%s\033X. They seem to go by the name of \033W%s\033X and have proven not to be a bright individual as they tried to conduct illegal activity in Paranid space. The local peace keepers have been notified of the criminal activity, and it is possible that they may choose to spare the smugglers for the moment, only to strike at them later when they least expect it. For now, we would like to encourage all station docking managers to ignore the criminal and not buy any of their wares. All righteous Paranid citizens should seek the smuggler out, scan their ship and force them to submit to our superiority. As stated before, the last sighting reports the location of the criminal to be in \033W%s\033X</t>
		<t id="125">Teladi profits are endangered by a smuggler! The economy cannot operate efficiently while illegal wares are in circulation - they cause an average drain that is not backed by other wares, causing the loss of a certain percentage of every profit. This is why smugglers are to be treated as no lesser criminals than murderers. This time a smuggler was sighted in \033W%s\033X. The local police officials have been notified of the smuggler's whereabouts and we eagerly await the elimination of \033W%s\033X and restoration of stability in our economy. While the Teladi have a more liberal approach to what is legal and what isn't, certain things are deemed illegal even here, due to their negative influence on free trade. Stay tuned, as we may release a bounty on the head of this smuggler, and it may lead to a new chance for profit!\n\nYoogossalis Solamalis Basilleosaris XVII - GalNet News</t>
		<t id="126">\033W%s\033X security officials have just announced the formation of a special task force to hunt down and stop smugglers. The recent confiscation of a freighter at a trading station has brought this problem to light and we are extremely surprised to see the severity of the issue. It seems that for one reason or another, smuggler activity was being covered up by a number of high ranking officials and a large scale investigation is now under way to see where the corruption exists and who is to blame for this. One reported suspicious ship is piloted by \033W%s\033X. Several ships from the military are now on constant patrol to stop this black market operation and remove this corruption from \033W%s\033X at the earliest opportunity.\n\nSis Crass - GalNet News</t>		
		<t id="130">Production Overflow in %s</t>
		<t id="131">Several labour unions have called a strike in a number of nearby tech factories. With the economy fragile, this unforeseen event may lead to huge problems, severely unbalancing it for several tazuras. For consumers however, there is an unexpected profit opportunity, the local Solar Power Plants in \033W%s\033X are getting overstocked and are forced to sell their energy cell units at the absolute minimum price. A number of free traders and opportunists have already obtained full holds of extremely cheap energy, and are now scouting for the best opportunities to off load them. The representatives of the Free Union of %s have issued a statement that they had not intended to cause harm to the Solar Power Plant owners and will stop the strike, for now, and wait for the local economy to stabilise before considering another form of protest. "It is not unavoidable that there will be another strike. It is by far the most effective means of peaceful protest, and we will not refrain from stating our demands." The energy prices are expected to go up soon, so all freelancers are advised to grab hold of the chance before it slips through their fingers.\n\nSamus Arendt - GalNet Economy News</t>
		<t id="132">The young Queen Menelaus and the Office of Efficiency have both officially commended the achievements of the Solar Power Plants in \033W%s\033X. Their managers have risked their own safety and temporarily disabled security restrictions imposed on the core software that runs all automated processes on the Solar Power Plants, netting a total production increase of nearly 200%.. They have dropped the prices of energy cells to the minimum, as the profit gained has already exceeded their daily quota, and are now just selling them off in a bid to inspire charity in Boron trader hearts and provide a slight boost to the local economy. The Boron benefactor said that he will not alter the price in respect to the purchaser, so traders of all races, even the Split, will be welcome. The energy cell stocks are running low already, and this unique offer will not stand forever. So if you have reasons to yearn for cheap energy, this may be your last chance.\n\nSamus Arendt - GalNet Economy News</t>
		<t id="133">The new Spacefly breed found in the Expansion region is extremely sensitive to rapid changes in illumination. Split energy manufacturers have exploited this unusual property to increase the productivity of their stations in \033W%s\033X. Though the Borons have raised objections to this newfound discovery, claiming that it is an abuse of harmless creatures as well as other nonsense, the Split overseers are reluctant to part with this technology, as it would mean reverting back to normal productivity levels that would subsequently trail the other races. This new technology is highly unreliable, and cannot provide a continuous boost to the energy production. Currently the market prices for energy cells in %s are at their minimum, but this may change very soon, so all Split traders are advised to hurry up and not let such an opportunity to go to waste.\n\nSamus Arendt - GalNet Economy News</t>
		<t id="134">Hard work and strict slave labour practices have resulted in overproduction within Solar Power Plants in \033W%s\033X. The managers of the local power plants were tasked with a special one-time order for a large number of energy cells, but the contract was broken shortly before its execution term. Now the stations are left with large amounts of surplus energy, and are selling them at the cheapest price possible. These energy cells are now filling up the station’s storage tanks and essentially halting the entire process, leading to idle employees and lazy slaves. The slave drivers have already said that this is a serious issue, as they are struggling to find new reasons for the further punishing of slaves as they are without any tasks at which they could fail. They hope that the cheap prices will ensure a quick disposal of the energy cells and a complete re-initialisation of the production process.\n\nSamus Arendt - GalNet Economy News</t>
		<t id="135">Solar activities lead to unexpected profit opportunities as Solar Power Plants reach their storage limits in \033W%s\033X. "Over the last tazura, the local sun has been undergoing an unexpected period of activity," says the renowned Boron astronomer Lila Gi. This unforeseen event has caught power plant managers by surprise, and the solar panels are now receiving almost double amounts of normal energy, leading to a dangerous strain in capacitor systems. The local overseer explains: "The Teladi were not ready for this much energy! Our conveyors were forced into overdrive, and a third of the capacitors have blown up already. We think either the solar flares were too much or nasty spies sabotaged our station. Now the station is almost full of energy cells and the Teladi will be forced to shut it down until there is more room!" Where some people see problems, others see opportunities. A Teladi trader, Yooglonus Laviconeleyas VI, had just enough time to say: "Teladi see much profits here. So much, Teladi will invest profit in stocks of the market. Teladi must hurry now, else other Teladi will get my profits." The local governor assured the station owners that he would offer any help necessary in replacing damaged technology, and has already sent two shuttles of experienced emergency worker brigades to help with the repairs. Meanwhile, we encourage all traders to help themselves to a full cargo of the cheapest energy cells this side of the galaxy.\n\nChan Boldrik - GalNet Economy News</t>
		<t id="136">The local power production plants in \033W%s\033X have come under a trader boycott due to poor management of the energy cell prices. In a desperate bid to attract free traders, that would at least ensure that the stations break even and do not stop their production due to lack of space in storage tanks, the station managers have lowered the energy cell prices to an absolute minimum, ensuring a safe profit opportunity for any traders out there. The leaders, terms and even the legitimacy of this boycott are all unknown, and the local sector governing officials have begun to look into this issue. The managers expect the boycott to be over quite soon, and have said that they will raise the energy prices up to average levels at the earliest opportunity. It still remains uncertain if this decision will lead to further protests, or if the government will get involved and propose a limit on price fluctuations? In the short term however, this means that free traders have a chance to nab the cheapest energy cells ever in %s.\n\nSamus Arendt - GalNet Economy News</t>	
		<t id="140">Resource Deficit in %s</t>
		<t id="141">Lax security has resulted in traders avoiding local stations. The most notable example is the absence of energy freighters, who seem to have begun a full-scale boycott of certain stations in this sector. The Paranid trader Ockammencasstrat explained: "Lowerlife station manager shows no respect for my Ship! He has no contract with the local police to ensure my safety, and he treats us traders as ungodly beings. He shall not receive any more of my freight - I will take my energy cells to more worthy beings from now on." What is interesting is the absence of Teladi traders, who would never normally pass an opportunity for profits such as this. The station manager has issued a plea for any traders that "are not stuck up", promising that he will readily pay top credits for functional batches of energy cells. As the Split curator of the Profit Guild, Hut F'Naak, said upon finishing the trading pyramid, "Without energy there is nothing to be produced. It is the base of all technology, and the one thing that everyone needs."\n\nDan Houser - GalNet Economy News</t>
		<t id="142">"The grace of the Queen has abandoned our stations, and precious energy isn't shipped here anymore." That is the current sentiment many Boron entrepreneurs share, seeing their stations cold and lifeless, their docking bays empty, their debts growing by the mizura. For reasons unknown, energy shipments have dwindled all throughout the wozura. Stations are working at below-average rates and a number of workers have already chosen to go with the flow and transfer to other sectors. Local supervisor Bolo Pi says that this shortage is only temporary, and a few good benefactors of the Queen with shipments of energy cells could turn the situation on its flipper and provide the much needed boost to production. As he said: "Anyone with spare energy cells in their hold is most welcome on our stations. We are willing to pay as much as we can and even throw in a free BoFu meal, if they so desire."\n\nBula Do - GalNet Economy News</t>
		<t id="143">Split stations are disposing of slaves when production halts because of the need for new energy cells. Production rates are falling by the stazura and many owners have chosen to set free their slaves out of the airlock in order not to lose even more credits. Recently Boron extremist 'creature-rights' activists have launched protest actions on some of the stations, claiming that they use an illegal labour force. Split station representatives state they are ready for a Gh'ok Deathmatch at any time to prove they're right. Predictably, the Boron have not responded, thus showing their cowardice. The problem now is that the extremists have recently intercepted several shipments of energy cells, halting the production of several factories. All friends of the family with energy cells are ordered to trade to their benefit and the Patriarch will look favourably upon them.\n\nZ'rt K'ruht - GalNet Economy News</t>
		<t id="144">Lowerlife energy cells were worthless!" So says the local station owner Ormanckabsellat, having been forced to dispose of countless tainted energy cell crates. His dealings with the lower beings were already under investigation from the Priest Duke, but he assures that he never knew of the treacherous plans of the Argon deviants to sabotage his shipments. Now the station is empty and dead, holy light no longer shines on the production lines and workers already question their devotion to the teachings of Three-Dimensionality.\n\nAll friends of the Priest Duke are asked to share their pure energy cell containers with those in need, for we cannot show such weakness to lesser beings!\n\nTackssimanssaglib - GalNet Economy News</t>
		<t id="145">The chance to gain easy profits is being foolishly ignored by local traders. Several stations are out of energy and offer lots of credits. For wozuras now traders show their lack of intelligence by ignoring the call of the credit. The manager of the station has begun to lose her scales because of the thought of precious profit slipping through her claws. She has already raised the prices of energy cells to their limits, in desperate hope that some will notice her station and deliver the energy cells to her.\n\nYosifeloneas Golnosiverris Lasuneas XII - GalNet Economy News</t>
		<t id="146">Local station managers have been suffering extreme energy cell shortages due to racial prejudice. Numerous people have reported that the races of the Commonwealth, including our so-called brethren, the Argon, are so suspicious of us that they refuse to close any deals in person. This trend seems to have sunk to new depths, with free traders ignoring the high price and large demand of energy cells in this sector, leaving some stations practically dead. An overseer of a factory told us that he had put all the equipment on stand-by mode because he didn't have enough energy to continue production even at a 10%. rate. He fears that the food resources will become unusable in the following wozura, and that the downtime may lead to a complete repossession of his station, should he fail to pay the taxes.\n\nnWe encourage all traders to help out a human in need and benefit from the deal at the same time!\n\nSenna Mauved - GalNet Economy News</t>

		<t id="220">Mysterious unknown vessel spotted nearby!</t>
		<t id="221">In recent news, the sector police have received reports from some local traders about mysterious new ships. It is claimed that these ships are very small and very fast and thought to be of scout or drone size. They have four bright lights on the bottom and a blinking one on top and they seem to have a new type of engine that leaves no exhaust trail. The traders reported a high-pitched sound coming from their audiocom every time they tried to approach, indicating a possible magnetic field surrounding the new ship. The local authorities have already issued a statement, claiming that this is all part of an elaborate hoax made up by the traders in order to gain public awareness of their dull, yet necessary jobs. The video files that were said to have visually captured the oddity, submitted in the last mazura, were discovered to be obviously fake showing it had been made by using fine string and a model carved out of frozen Cahoonas. Despite the denial, the Goner Sect has issued the following statement: "The Gatekeepers are monitoring the network and so you may stumble upon their drones by accident. Take care not to anger them in any way." The common response to this that floats on the airwaves is: "These guys have gone bonkers."\n\nJana Polak - GalNet Service News</t>
		<t id="222">The Queen's Guardians, our special service section that deals with space anomalies, have put out an alert to local police forces warning them of unknown spy drones. The drones are said to have first been noticed by a cartographer who was updating the local sector map after micro-particles had moved one of the gates by a few atoms width. The drone had induced a high pitch squeal in the communication systems of the cartographer's ship, pushing the brave Boron into a temporary comatose state. Once he’d recovered, he made a full report including pictures of the drone, and this has already been relayed to Queen Antreus herself. The drone is said to be medusa-shaped, with a rapidly blinking light on top and four engine pods on the bottom. The design of the drone is reminiscent of early Argon technology, so the Guardians have contacted the Argon Senators and demanded an explanation for this incursion.\n\nShould you see the drone yourselves, you are advised not to approach it in any way as its offensive capabilities are still unknown.

The losses were significant, but military strategists claim that the number of casualties is still far lower than they had anticipated. The only concern noted during the raid was the obvious lack of proper teamwork among the generals of each task force group. The Paranid captains refused to obey any orders and pleas given by the other races, the Split had no consideration for any safety whatsoever forcing the Teladi capital craft to come to their aid and act as a physical shield, and the Terran and Argon capital ships exchanged small amounts of friendly fire due to an obvious and unprecedented oversight by the gunnery crews of both ships. However, on the whole, the operation has been deemed to be successful, and new plans are already being made for further raids. It is expected that \033W%s\033X will not long remain clear of Xenon, but at least they have been pushed back and forced to rebuild, which will hopefully buy all races some time and help greatly reduce Xenon incursions into race-controlled territories.\n\nNatalie Rhyners - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="375">Welcome to the Teladi Repair Service. With our exceptional service you are free to relax and let your credits do the negotiating. If you own a damaged ship or station in the current sector, our special Uplink Protocol will automatically register it, so you can select them for repairing. They will be added to our repair schedule, and once a mechanic team is free, they will respond to your call. We usually respond within sezuras, but in the unlikely event that all our mechanics decide to go on strike, or retire, we will keep your request active for a period of up to two jazuras from the original date. Naturally, no refunds are available.\n\nTeladi Repair Service Automated Database\n\n</t>

If you do have more assets to repair, please position them in your current sector, so we can pick them up. If you do not have any ships or stations in need of repair, please stop pestering our systems with unnecessary request calls.

I can assist you by removing the biohazard tag from your ship, but as it requires no small effort, the Boron would humbly request \033Y%s\033X credits for administration costs. The Boron hope that you do the smart thing and cooperate, as we are forced to remind you that the consequences of bio-terrorism are taken very seriously in this area of space.\n\nShould you choose to accept, there will be no need for an official report on this, if you get our meaning...</t>

Of course, we do not do this voluntarily, so a Police license renewal holder tax of \033Y%s\033X credits would be a reasonable affirmation of your willingness to cooperate.</t>
		<t id="680">Corruption of the law?</t>
		<t id="681">Over the last mazura, several pilots have claimed to have been pressurised for various amounts of money by the local police forces in the Expansion Region. So far all the races have denied any possibility of corruption among their forces. One of the accused police pilots, Lugu Di of the Boron Royal Police, claimed that he had never operated in the sector the alleged extortion took place. He also stated that no official report had been filed against him, and that he would be determined to prove his innocence should the need arise. This is somewhat surprising given that a number of allegedly harassed pilots all claim to have filed numerous complaints against this one individual. Similar denials have been made by Argon, Paranid and Terran police officers. GalNet News would like to remind everyone of the right to view any accusation made against them and confer with a state-assigned lawyer before consenting to any action short of warranted arrest.\n\nJill Narbal - GalNet News</t>
		<t id="682">Aldrian pilots forced to pay for 'protection'</t>
		<t id="683">It has been brought to the media attention that several Aldrian traders operating in alien space have been asked to transfer varying amounts of credits to official police officers. The police had intercepted them mid-flight and then threatened to destroy or repossess their ships unless an untraceable transaction was made. Our ambassadors have asked for an explanation from the governments of the other races, but so far no answer has been forthcoming. Meanwhile, our own police authority would like to deny all rumours of corrupt police officers operating in the Solara system.\n\nWenn Backard - Solara News Network</t>
		<t id="684">Office of Naval Intelligence investigates possible police corruption</t>
		<t id="685">Recently, a handful of traders from various races had filed complaints about being extorted for ‘protection’ money by Terran police officers at various sectors and times. An official internal investigation has been launched and is being overseen by the Office of Naval Intelligence, although any results will be classified. Whether such claims of corruption are accurate is not certain, as a number of our officers have stated that the complaints have been falsified in a desperate bid to ‘get revenge’ on the police for doing their job properly. Meanwhile, similar reports have come to light throughout the Expansion Region, therefore we urge our traders to remain vigilant and have at least one recording device onboard their ships to provide sufficient proof of any possible future extortion attempts.\n\nKurt Russell - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="1000">Federation territory expanded yet again</t>
		<t id="1001">The Federation of Argon is pleased to announce that the newly claimed sector, hereafter known as %s, is now open to civilian traffic and entrepreneurs. The 2nd Argon Exploration Fleet uncovered this area two tazuras ago, but public notification was not permitted due to the Sector Safety Standard rule. This secondary clause in the Expansion Region's sector acquisition laws states that every new area must be checked for hostile activity and environmental hazards before establishing a permanently active gate connection.\n\nWhether the new sector is merely a dead-end or a stepping stone on a whole new path is not known, but the President of the Federation of Argon has already expressed his view. He has claimed that each and every sector of the Federation is of the highest importance for the well-being of all our citizens.\n\nSam Weishaupt - Interstellar Broadcast Corporation</t>
		<t id="1002">Exploration fleet finds new sector</t>
		<t id="1003">It has just been brought to public attention that the 2nd Argon Exploration Fleet has successfully uncovered yet another area of the Expansion Region. As no hazardous anomalies have been detected on the long-range scanners, the Office of Circumferential Interstellar Acquisitions has agreed to permanently activate a gateway to the new sector. It will be known by the name of %s. \n\nWith trade routes expected to be established within the following stazuras, the Federation of Argon has already established key infrastructure assets. In the coming tazuras, the Exploration Fleet is expected to set off on a new classified mission in hopes of revealing further unclaimed areas.\n\nSuzan McCamp - Interstellar Broadcast Corporation.</t>
		<t id="1004">New sector established</t>
		<t id="1005">The theory claiming that the Expansion Region could not possibly contain more than a handful of sectors has been shattered once again. To further underline the point, the Federation of Argon has claimed another new sector, known as %s. It is expected to be an economically sound area, but due to the unpredictable nature of the Expansion Region, it is not advised to take for granted a colonisation boom.\n\nEven though there were a number of unexplained issues with surveillance modules, the authorities have officially acknowledged the Argon claim as valid and agreed to classify the sector as safe unless further incidents occur. By latest estimates, this sector brings the total of Argon Federation's area of controlled space past that of the Paranid Empire. Now the Exploration Fleets have a new impetus to continue mapping the unknown reaches of space, as the Paranid colony fleets are not far behind in their progress.\n\nMark Jason - Interstellar Broadcast Corporation</t>

		<t id="1006">More space for Borons in space!</t>
		<t id="1007">Even though the economy of the Boron Kingdom has seen better days, the Boron people have yet another reason to rejoice, for a new sector has been officially added to the Royal Map. The new area, known as %s, was found by pure chance, after the Expedition fleet noticed an anomalous gravitational field in an asteroid cluster. It took them nearly two stazuras to clear the debris and uncover the gate structure. Now, measures have been taken to ensure that the gate, and its immediate vicinity, remains safe for traversal.\n\nThis discovery of new territory has come as a relief to the many colonists who have been living in cramped habitation tanks for wozuras. The traders, who will be responsible for the proper integration of the sector into the trading network, however remain sceptical. They are claiming that while new territory is always welcome, a properly rich mineral source would be even more valuable.\n\nBolo Pi - Royal Commonwealth News</t>
		<t id="1008">Queen Menelaus reveals new sector</t>
		<t id="1009">It is with great pleasure that the Royal Office of Public Relations wishes to announce that a new sector, %s, has been officially deigned as suitable for inclusion into the magnificent Kingdom of Boron. Her esteemed highness, Queen Menelaus herself was present at the uncovering ceremony, with her loyal Chamberlain labouring to activate the connection of the new sector to the already settled territories.\n\nIt is expected that a proper infrastructure will be established shortly, and of course Boron citizens will welcome all traders from other races in the hope of forming long-lasting and reliable trade routes and treaties. It is doubtless expected that more sectors lie beyond the next gate, and the persistence and loyalty of the captains leading the Expedition Fleet will be sure to bring fruitful results in the coming tazuras.\n\nLulu Ni - Royal Commonwealth News</t>
		<t id="1010">New addition to the Kingdom</t>
		<t id="1011">The labours of the Royal Expedition Fleet have not gone unnoticed, and the Kingdom of Boron is now officially larger by one sector. %s was discovered and claimed in short order, leaving no possible doubt or legal question as to the ownership of the area. The lead strategist from the Royal Military stated that while the rush for new territories lasts, the Kingdom cannot afford to leave its territory divided and scattered. Currently, the Expansion is progressing at an acceptable rate, yet it must not be forgotten that other races are more than eager to gain advantage over each other, no matter what the cost.\n\nThough the number of installations within the area is still small, all traders are encouraged to use the new opportunities and establish their trade routes while there still is room. Likewise, all budding entrepreneurs are encouraged to augment their businesses by establishing their own stations to supplement the existing economy.\n\nLulu Gi - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="1012">Empire strengthened with new sector</t>
		<t id="1013">Once again the Xaar's wisdom of undertaking territorial expansion has proven to be the wise course. Another strategically important location has been claimed in the name of the Paranid Empire. Hereafter, development and colonisation will take place in %s as per the Duke's orders. The Colonisation Fleet has moved onwards, and the new territory is under the protection of the Paranid Military. Trade will be allowed for all higher creatures, along with the opportunities the new area will provide.\n\nKiltmanckaslift - Imperial Paranid News</t>
		<t id="1014">New territories added to the Paranid rule</t>
		<t id="1015">Grand Priest Xaar has announced that %s is henceforth under Paranid rule. This latest achievement of the Paranid Empire has been deemed a strategical success, paramount to solidifying the Priest Xaar's grasp on the Expansion Region. The local planet has been settled already, and critical infrastructure construction is taking place at this very moment. However it could still be several stazuras before all drafted stations are placed, but a number of trade opportunities are expected to arise shortly.\n\nKisnamanckassaltack - Imperial Paranid News</t>

		<t id="1018">Split claim new sector</t>
		<t id="1019">The Split dynasties have claimed %s under the rule of Patriarch Rhonkar. All non-military creatures are permitted to traverse the sector, build infrastructure and trade there. The new territories are under full Split Military protection, any criminal activities will not be tolerated.\n\nCho t'Knnt - Split Clan News</t>
		<t id="1020">Another foothold for the dynasties</t>
		<t id="1021">Patriarch Rhonkar's Exploration Fleet has uncovered another sector. With the general approval from most leading Split clans, the new addition has been named %s.

		<t id="1022">Split territories expand</t>
		<t id="1023">In last mizuras, the Expansion Council under the rule of Patriarch Rhonkar has unveiled a new sector, claimed by the Split dynasties. Known as %s, the new area is open for trade and development, and is under close watch by the Split Military. Martial laws apply for all Split sectors in the Expansion Region. Split military has permission to shoot to kill. Criminal activities shall not be tolerated. Visitors are welcome.\n\nSht t'Pkkt - Split Clan News</t>

		<t id="1024">Foothold for business established</t>
		<t id="1025">The CEO of the Teladi Company has announced that the latest acquisition, %s, has been unveiled for public access. Though the location and resources contained in it could have been better, the increase of assets has nevertheless been acknowledged as a smart long-term move. Traders and businessmen of all races are welcome to use the opportunities of this yet unfulfilled market niche. The Teladi Company is prepared to endure short-term losses in order to stimulate the development of the area, hopefully augmented by further colonisations. A ten-jazura break-even period is expected for the sector at worst, if no other races decide to establish their stations there. The regional managers however are more optimistic, they predict a three and a half jazuras break-even period, provided that no unforseen crisis occurs.\n\nYossilleas Nogossillanis Sillesalliass XIV - Central Economy News</t>
		<t id="1026">Shareholders rejoice as new sector is unveiled</t>
		<t id="1027">A last-mizura announcement regarding the newly claimed %s has forced the stock values of the Teladi Company to rise by nearly ten creditpercent. Complete information on the new sector's assets has not yet been revealed, but estimates are inclined toward the richer end of sector spectrum values. The Company has already begun establishing interstellar trading infrastructure, with orders for stations queueing up to be placed. The Teladi Company encourages all traders to use the opportunity while it is there, regardless of race or destination of goods. With long-term vision taking precedence, short-term losses are expected and should be accounted for.\n\nNogislleas Nopileassanis Yosillis III - Central Economy News</t>
		<t id="1028">Teladi Company expands its reach</t>
		<t id="1029">It has been brought to public attention that the Teladi Company has asserted its claim over yet another sector in the expansion region. %s will now be open to civilian traffic, along with numerous opportunities for business ventures and trade. The local police have affirmed their support for all traders, and the Teladi Military has reminded all businessmen that any stations within the sector will be under their protection, regardless of their management. Every new sector is thought to be of great value to the Teladi Company, yet independent market analysts say that an overly rapid expansion may lead to a breakdown within the local economy and an exhaustion of resources. The Teladi Company Venture offices deny any such claims, reminding that short-term losses are expected and will be balanced by longer term gains.\n\nSylvanneas Lockillis Naguhalis X - Central Economy News</t>

		<t id="1030">Another sector claimed for the Terran Democracy</t>
		<t id="1031">Though the Solaran refusal to acknowledge the Democracy's right to the lost colonies has been a point of contention for tazuras, our government has not been passive. With great pride, the discovery and settling of %s was announced just mizuras ago. This new sector is a leap forward for the Terran Democracy, and one more step towards the relocation and a proper establishment of a number of Terra's resources. Currently the sector is still being populated, but civilians are welcome to trade and build within the territory according to Terran laws. The United Space Command will keep watch over all Terran sectors, and will respond appropriately to any illegal activity.\n\nMerak Nogle - Terran Morning News</t>
		<t id="1032">Sector open for trade</t>
		<t id="1033">The Terran Democracy has announced that a new sector, known as %s, is open for public access. Only recently discovered, it was agreed to be best suited serving as a regular hub for commerce and business. Though the stations planned for it have not yet been fully established, all friends of the Terran Democracy are permitted to build their own stations there, adhering to the Terran Democracy's laws.\n\nJim Saliciental - Terran Morning News</t>
		<t id="1034">Terran Democracy extends its territory</t>
		<t id="1035">It has just been revealed that a new area has been discovered by the colonisation fleets of the United Space Command. Full Terran control over the new sector %s has already been established, and construction of stations and production assembly lines is taking place. In accordance with Terran law, all friends of the Terran Democracy are allowed to build and trade in the new area. \n\nThis new foothold in the Expansion Region has strengthened our Democracy and improved the strategic positioning of Terran-controlled space in comparison to the alien races. Though the metric area of space is not sufficient to qualify as the largest among the newly controlled zones, the new sector has greatly improved the Democracy's standing in the expansion colonisation race.\n\nSally Sue - Terran Morning News</t>
